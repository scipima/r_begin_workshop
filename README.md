# First steps in data analysis and visualisation with R
This repo forms the background for a beginner-level workshop focused on teaching how to analyse and plot data with R.

The ideas and codes in the main script - `r_begin_workshop.qmd` - borrow heavily from a number of sources:

* [Data Visualization for Social Science](https://socviz.co/index.html#preface)
* David Robinson's [Tidy Tuesday live screencast: Analyzing UN votes in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RadZrpzTaA)

Section 5 gives a quick overview of how to create plots with `R`'s `ggplot` suite of visualisation tools.
Section 6 introduces simple aggregations and functions - Section 7 and 8 provide examples of joins and loops, and gently encourage the user to experiment writing more complex pieces of codes.
